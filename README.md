# Kalman-Filter 

This program in Python allows to fit the **Kalman filter Rescorla-Wagner model** to behavioral data.

The initial code in Matlab is based on the previous work of Sam Gershman, at the Department of Psychology and Center for Brain Science, Harvard University [(See his GitHub here!)](https://github.com/sjgershm/KF-learning). This model is introduced in his paper [*A Unifying Probabilistic View of Associative Learning*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004567&type=printable) which describes a framework encompassing Bayesian and reinforcement learning theories of associative learning.
