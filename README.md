# Kalman-Filter 

This program in Python allows to fit the **Kalman filter Rescorla-Wagner model** to behavioral data.

The initial code in Matlab is based on the previous work of Sam Gershman, at the Department of Psychology and Center for Brain Science, Harvard University [(See his GitHub here!)](https://github.com/sjgershm/KF-learning). This model is introduced in his paper [*A Unifying Probabilistic View of Associative Learning*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004567&type=printable) which describes a framework encompassing Bayesian and reinforcement learning theories of associative learning.

## What is the Kalman Filter? 






## Programming for Brain and Cognitive Sciences. 

This code was part of the course PBCS from the Cogmaster at the ENS (Paris, France). 

I had previous experience in coding using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also used MATLAB to analyse my data. However, these skills were were self-thought, so I never learned how to optimise and write a clean code.

I think that through this course I gained proficiency using Python, which is a language I never programmed in before. This is especially useful as nowadays, more and more Cognitive Neuroscience lab use Python to code their experiments and analyse their data. 

It also encouraged me to use more GitHub to organise my code (especially through literate  programming of which I am now a fan), and to allow more reproducible science. It also opened my eyes on the benefits of open source, and I am considering switching to Linux. 

Nonetheless, I still wish that we would have been able to do more language (I know it is difficult to implement MATLAB but the reality is still that most labs are using it). I also wish that we would have been able to learn more optimisation of our codes rather than the coding of experiment itself. Even though it is great to have a wide variety of levels, I think that it can results in frustration in both those with lower levels and  those with strong coding abilities. I wish there were two classes with different levels so each can benefit most of the course.
